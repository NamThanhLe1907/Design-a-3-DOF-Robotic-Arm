The robot was designed and guided through my lecturer, Ph.D Nguyen Van Thai. Thank you very much for this project.
The arduino code is running kinda slow, need to press the button multiple times to run the robot. This problem will be solved if I have more time to research it.
Any questions please send to my email: namthanhle1907@gmail.com.
